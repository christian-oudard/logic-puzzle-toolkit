housekeeping:
- refactor Board.set_number, it's only used once
- redo debug messages
- add more complex test solves for nurikabe

solving:
- make a unit test with a huge blank board
- audit solve order, breadth versus depth first
- test if board is already solved
  . audit how it's currently being checked for solution
  . branch finding solution when looking for contradiction
    . detect multiple solutions
- adjust priority function constants

gui:
- do square grid
  . move triangle or square grid display functions to new class
- solve puzzles interactively
- show slowed-down solving animation
- buttons and stuff
  . "attempt to solve" button
  . check box for whether to immediately show invalid
- localized invalidity display

optimization:
- try different version of is_success function
- make switches to quickly turn on or off optimization methods. test every combination and see whether they are all necessary
